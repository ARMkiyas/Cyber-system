For the best experience, please run Cyber_system.exe executable file;

if you are compile and run with Qunicy, some time Quincy won't compile the file, may be it will show many errors,
so to compile plese use GCC compile commands(GCC or mingw compiler needed)  

instruction for compile using gcc(CMD)
	1. open command prompt
	2. cd "file folder path"
	3. gcc "Cyber_system.c" -o Cyber_system
 
if you have any problems with Compile and Run the program, please trun off your antivirus(real time protection) software.
